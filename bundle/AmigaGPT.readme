Kurz: App zum Chatten mit ChatGPT

AmigaGPT is a text generation program that runs on the classic AmigaOS. Utilising the power of the OpenAI's GPT-3 and GPT-4 architectures, this program brings state-of-the-art language modeling to your Amiga computer.

Features:
- Generates text based on input prompts
- UI customisation
- Full conversation history
- Text-to-speech

Requirements:
- OCS/ECS/AGA Amiga
- Motorola 68020 or higher CPU
- AmigaOS 3.2 or higher OS
- AmiSSL 5.8 or higher. Here is the latest version at the time of writing (http://aminet.net/util/libs/AmiSSL-5.9-OS3.lha)
- Internet access using a TCP/IP stack such as Roadshow (http://roadshow.apc-tcp.de/index-en.php)
- An active OpenAI API key
- For speech, any version of narrator.device

Installation:
1. Install AmiSSL and a TCP/IP stack if not already done so
2. Unpack the archive to a directory of your choice.
3. Run the Installer script included in the package.
4. Follow the prompts to complete the installation.

Optional steps to enable speech functionality:
AmigaGPT supports reading the output aloud. This requires a file called `narrator.device` which cannot be included with AmigaGPT because it is still under copyright. Therefore, you must copy this file legally from your Workbench disks so that AmigaGPT will be able to synthesise speech. There are 2 versions of `narrator.device` supported, v34 and v37. 

v34 is the original version that came with Workbench 1.x. v37 was an updated version included with Workbench 2.0.x. It has more features and sounds more natural, however it does sound quite different which is why AmigaGPT supports you installing both versions and your choice of version to be used can be selected in the Speech menu in the app.

Regardless of which version of `narrator.device` you choose to install (or both), AmigaGPT requires that you install the free third party `translator.library` **v43**. This works with both versions of `narrator.device`.

Installing `translator.library` v43:
Since `translator.library` v43 is not available as a standalone install, you will need to install v42 and then patch it to v43.
* Download http://aminet.net/util/libs/translator42.lha and extract the archive to any convenient location on your Amiga such as `RAM:`
* Navigate to that directory and double click the `Install` program
* Run the installer using all the default settings
* Download http://aminet.net/util/libs/Tran43pch.lha and once again extract it to a location of your choice
* Navigate to that directory and double click the `Install` program
* Run the installer using all the default settings


Installing `narrator.device` v34:
* Insert your Workbench 1.x disk and copy `df0:devs/narrator.device` to `{AmigaGPTProgramDirectory}/devs/speech/34`

Installing `narrator.device` v37
* Insert your Workbench 2.0.x (you cannot use 2.1 because the speech libraries were removed after version 2.0.4) disk and copy `df0:devs/narrator.device` to `{AmigaGPTProgramDirectory}/devs/speech/37`

Launching AmigaGPT:
* Launch the application by double-clicking the AmigaGPT icon
* You may also launch the app in the command line but before you do, run the command `STACK 20000` to give the program 20kb of stack since the default stack size for apps launched from the shell is 4kb and this is not enough for AmigaGPT and will cause random crashes due to stack overflow. This is not required when you lauch the app by double clicking the icon since the stack size is saved in the icon.

Usage:
When launched, AmigaGPT presents you with a choice of opening the app in a new screen or opening in Workbench. If you open in a new screen you have the ability to create a screen for the app to open in. AmigaGPT supports anything from 320x200 all the way up to 4k resolution if using a video card for RTG. Bear in mind text will appear very tiny in resolutions above 1080p so you may want to increase the font size settings from the View menu when the app opens.

When launching for the first time you will need to enter your OpenAI API key before you can start chatting. If you haven't already done so, create an OpenAI account and navigate to https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys to generate an API key for use with AmigaGPT.

When the app has opened, you are presented with a text input box. You can type any prompt into this box and press "Send" to see the GPT-4 model's response. The generated text appears in the box above the input. You can choose to have this text read aloud using the "Speech" menu option. You can also select which model for OpenAI to use in the "OpenAI" menu option.

To the left of the chat box is a conversation list which you can use to go to another saved conversation. New conversations can be created with the "New chat" button and conversations can be removed with the "Delete chat" button.

In the "Edit" menu, you'll find basic text editing commands like Cut, Copy, Paste and Clear. The "View" menu allows you to change the font used in the chat and the UI.

The "Project" menu includes an "About" option, which displays information about the program.

Developing:
Source code hosted at https://github.com/sacredbanana/AmigaGPT

If you would like to build this project from source you will need Bebbo's **amiga-gcc** toolchain here https://github.com/bebbo/amiga-gcc
Be sure to add `NDK=3.2` to the `make` options. Once your `amiga-gcc` dev environment is installed, you will need to download the AmiSSL and Translator SDK's from http://aminet.net/util/libs/AmiSSL-5.8-SDK.lha & http://aminet.net/util/libs/translator42.lha and extract the include header files into your `amiga-gcc` environment. By default this will be located at `/opt/amiga/m68k-amigaos/include`. Once this is set up all you will need to do to build the project is navigate to the project root directory and run the `make` command. The built app will appear in the `out` directory.
